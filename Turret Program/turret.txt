Turret program:
- Going to track someone in 3D space
- Going to wait till they are still for 3 seconds
- Going to shoot them with nerf darts

Ideas:
- Maybe I could first track the position of a gyroscope
    - Then later on I can implement tracking with a camera
- Program will aim at gyroscope
- Also add the ability for safe and armed mode
- Also add the ability to manually aim
